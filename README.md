# ReportMind-RAG-Driven-Analytical-Insight-Engin
#Buisness Context

Growing organizations generate massive amounts of reports and data critical for decision-making. For example, venture capital analysts at firms like Andreessen Horowitz must extract insights from dense documents such as HBR’s “How Apple is Organized for Innovation.” Manual review is slow and inefficient, but Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can deliver quick, precise answers to targeted questions, enabling faster strategic insights.

#Objective
Build a RAG application that allows business analysts to quickly extract key insights from lengthy reports, improving efficiency and decision-making.
